This workshop source repository contains the build recipe for a docker container derived from the CCPBioSim JupyterHub image. This container adds the necessary software packages and notebook content to form a deployable course container.

This workshop walks through the process of preparing a simple protein system for molecular dynamics simulation using [Ambertools](https://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php). In addition, it showcases the use of [Alphafix](https://github.com/CharlieLaughton/Alphafix) to remediate crystal structure-derived models (identify and rebuild missing atoms and residues).

## How to Use

This training course is deployed on the [CCPBioSim](www.ccpbiosim.ac.uk) website via our cloud infrastructure, however you can deploy on your own machine with docker.

Pull the container from our repository::

    docker pull ghcr.io/ccpbiosim/protein-preparation-workshop:latest

In our containers we are using the JupyterHub default port 8888, so you should
forward this port when deploying locally::

    docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/ccpbiosim/protein-preparation-workshop:latest
